The Human Interactions Guidelines
These guidelines are more of a common sense approach to designing any app that may go in the
App store.
The guidelines go into  making sure that the user of any app always can tell what is going on in the app, designing to not ask them for too much input to get started so they will not get bored, and if you have to ask them for any permissions, make sure it is in exchange for something.
The user should never get bored or have to work hard to figure out gestures or how to use the app.


The App Store Review Guidelines
These guidelines are pretty simple, and going through the documentation there are a just a few of points that I feel Apple highlights numerous times, in different ways, that are the most important.
The first one that I feel is important is that no matter what point of view you may be presenting within your app that it is respectful. There is nothing degrading, offensive, or no one will be disrespected if they use your app.
The next important review point I feel is the importance of not copying someone else's work. There are a couple sections dedicated to this, from the copycat section, to intellectual property section. But the point of it is have your own idea, do your own work.
The last point that I felt was important was having complete work. With that said, having all the parts of your app working before uploading for review and making sure that the customers data is secure, all the processes and meta data are handled properly, and that the app is just ready to go!
